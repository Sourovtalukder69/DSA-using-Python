# Data structures are a way to organize and store data effectively, providing means to manage and manipulate the data efficiently. Algorithms, on the other hand, are step-by-step procedures or formulas used to solve problems or perform tasks, often utilizing these data structures to achieve a specific objective. In essence, data structures determine how data is organized, while algorithms outline the steps to process that data efficiently.



# Data Structures are:
#  Arrays, linked list, stacks, queues, hashmap, binary trees, graphs, priority queyes

# Algorithms are :
# search, sorting, binary search,  recursion, dynamic programming, greedy, bfs


# For solving problem : LeetCode - Easy(30%), Medium(50%), Hard(20%)  Totally= 300 is enough


# # # #  Solving programming problems demonstrates the following traits:

 # 1.You can think about a problem systematically and solve it systematically step-by-step.
 # 2.You can envision different inputs, outputs, and edge cases for programs you write.
 #  3.You can communicate your ideas clearly to co-workers and incorporate their suggestions.
 # 4.Most importantly, you can convert your thoughts and ideas into working code that's also readable.

# # # # # systematic strategy we'll apply for solving problems:

# 1. State the problem clearly. Identify the input & output formats.
# 2. Come up with some example inputs & outputs. Try to cover all edge cases.
# 3. Come up with a correct solution for the problem. State it in plain English.
# 4. Implement the solution and test it using example inputs. Fix bugs, if any.
# 5. Analyze the algorithm's complexity and identify inefficiencies, if any.
# 6. Apply the right technique to overcome the inefficiency. Repeat steps 3 to 6.
# What is Data structure ?
#  Data Structure  is a way to store and oraganize data efficiently.



# Why need data structure ?
# There are certain problem in computer science which are difficult to solve. To solve this problem need data structure which can solve this problem  verry efficiently
 

# There are two types of Data structure
#   1. Linear : Array, linkedlist, Stacks, Queues, Hashing 
#              

#   2.Non linear : Trees, graph
